### Threat Models mapped to Risks

* every risk identified in the Threat Model needs to be opened and tracked in the JIRA Risk project
* using Confluence to host the Threat Model content and have 'live' queries with the relevant risks (makes a massive difference in the maintainability of these Threat Models)
  * When special views are needed, Jira's JQL Queries can be used to create some of the queries
