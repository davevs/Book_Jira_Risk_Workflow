### Creating Abuse Cases

Developer teams tend to focus on the 'Happy Paths', where everything works out exactly as expected. However, in agile environments, creating evil user stories linked to a user story can be a powerful technique to convey higher level threats.

**Evil user stories (Abuse cases)**

Evil user stories have a dependency with threat modeling and can be an effective way of translating higher level threats and mitigations. They can be imagined as a kind of malicious Murphy's law [^Murphy-law].

Take for example a login flow. After doing a threat model on this flow one should have identified the following information:

Attackers:
  * registered users
  * unregistered users

Assets:
  * credentials
  * customer information

With this information, the following threats can be constructed:

  * unregistered users bypassing the login functionality
  * unregistered users enumerating accounts
  * unregistered users brute-forcing passwords
  * registered users accessing other users' information

At the same time the team has constructed the following user stories that should be implemented:
  * _"as a registered user I want to be able to login with my credentials so I can access my information"_

Combined with the outcome of the threat model, the following evil user stories can be constructed:
  * _"as an unregistered user I should not be able to login without credentials, and access customer information"_
  * _"as an unregistered user I should not be able to identify existing accounts and use them to attempt to login"_
  * _"as a user I should not be able to have unlimited attempts to log in and hijack someone's account"_
  * _"as an authenticated user I should not be able to access other users' information"_
