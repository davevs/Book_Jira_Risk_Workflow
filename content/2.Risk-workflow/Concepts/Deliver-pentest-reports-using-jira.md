### Deliver PenTest reports using JIRA

Using JIRA to deliver PenTest reports is much more efficient than creating a PDF to do so.  Using JIRA allows for both a quick validation of findings, and direct communication between the developers and the AppSec team.

If customized properly, there are a number of tools that can act as triage tools between PenTest results and JIRA:

  * 'defect dojo'
  * 'bag of holding'
  * ThreadFix
  * Other...

Threat Modeling tools could also work well between PenTest results and JIRA.
