### Ten minute hack vs one day work

* 10m hacks vs 1 day proper coding will create more RISK tickets and source comments
* I get asked this a lot from developers
* There has to be a quantitive difference, which needs to be measured

**That code sucks**

* Ok can you prove it?
  * Code analysers in IDE can help identify known bad patterns and provide awareness
* Why is it bad?

**In new code legacy**
- if it also hard to refactor and change, then yes
