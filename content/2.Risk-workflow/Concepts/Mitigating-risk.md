### Mitigating Risk

One strategy to handle risk is to mitigate it. 

Sometimes, external solutions, such as a WAF, provide a more effective solution.

If a WAF fixed the issue, and there are tests that prove it, then it is a valid fix.  In this case, it is important to create a new RISK which says _"Number of security vulnerabilities are currently being mitigated using a WAF. If that WAF is disabled, or if there is a WAF bypass exploit, then the vulnerabilities will become exploitable"_
