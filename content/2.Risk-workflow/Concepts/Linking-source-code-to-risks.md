### Linking source code to Risks

If you add links to risk as source code comments, you deploy a powerful and very useful technique with many benefits.

When you add links to the root cause location, and all the places where the risk exists, you make the risk visible. This reinforces the concept of cost (i.e. pollution) when insecure, or poor quality, code is written.  Linking the source code to risk becomes a positive model when fixes delete the comments. When the comments are removed, the AppSec team is alerted to the need for a security review.  Finally, tools can be built that will scan for these comments and provide a 'risk pollution' indicator.
