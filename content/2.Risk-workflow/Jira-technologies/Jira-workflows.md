### JIRA workflows

- explain what they are what makes them powerful
- key components of it

- a good workflow tells a story and guides the user down specific paths

**Tidy up your diagrams**

It is important that your diagrams have layouts that look good and make sense.

The Diagram UI allows a bit of flexibility on where the Stages appear, so make use it and create nice diagrams

- show where they can be seen in the UI
- makes big difference when they are easy to read and understand
- I hide the labels since I find that they are harder to position and don't provide that much more information

- add example of two diagrams diagrams. Same content: one messy and one clean
  * note how the clean one is much easier to read

**Naming of states**

- This is very important since they need to convey the desired action
- names have to be short or they don't look good in the UI
