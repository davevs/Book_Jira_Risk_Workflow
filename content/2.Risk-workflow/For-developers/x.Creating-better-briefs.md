### Creating better briefs

Developers should use the JIRA workflow to get better briefs and project plans from management. Threat Models are also a key part of this strategy.

Developers seldom find the time to fulfil the non-functional requirements of their briefs. The JIRA workflow gives developers this time.  

The JIRA workflow can help developers to solve many problems they have in their own development workflow (and SDL).
