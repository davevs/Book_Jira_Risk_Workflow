### Make managers accountable

Managers need to be held accountable for the decisions they make, especially when those decisions have implications for quality and security. There are several benefits to increased accountability. Organisations will be encouraged to accept risk, and, before they click on the 'Accept Risk' button,  managers will be compelled to 'read' the ticket information. However, the introduction and development of a more accountable management structure is a long game, to be played out over many months, or even years. Sometimes, it requires a change in management to create the right dynamic environment. 

Usually, a new manager will not be too enthusiastic when he sees the risks that are currently accepted by a business and are now his responsibility. He knows he has a limited window, of a few months perhaps, where he can blame his predecessor for any problems. After that time has passed, he 'owns' the risk, and has accepted it himself.

This workflow creates historical records of decisions, which supports and reinforces a culture of accountability.

In agile environments, the Product Owner is responsible for making the right decisions.
