### Using logs to detect risks exploitation

Are your logs and dashboards good enough to tell you what is going on?
You should know when new and existing vulnerabilities are discovered or exploited. However, this is a difficult problem that requires serious resources and technology. 

It is crucial that you can at least detect known risks without difficulty. Being able to detect known risks is one reason to create a suite of tests that can run against live servers. Not only will those tests confirm the status of those issues across the multiple environment, they will provide the NOC (Network Operations Centre) with case studies of what they should be detecting.

#### Beware of the security myth

Often, no special software or expertise is needed to identify basic, potential, bad behavior.
Usually, companies already have all the tools and technology they need in-house. The problem is making those tools work in the company's reality.
For example, if someone accesses 20 non-existing pages per second for several minutes, it is most likely they are brute-forcing the application.
You can easily identify this by monitoring for 404 and 403 errors per IP address over time.
