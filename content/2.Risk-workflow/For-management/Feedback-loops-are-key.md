### Feedback loops are key

A common error occurs when the root cause of newly discovered issues or exploits receives insufficient energy and attention from the right people.

Initially, operational monitoring or incident response teams identify new incidents. They send the incidents are to the security department, and after some analysis the development teams receive them as tickets. The development teams receive no information about the original incident, and are therefore unable to frame the request in the right perspective. This can lead to suboptimal fixes with undesired side effects.

It is beneficial to include development teams in the root cause analysis from the start, to ensure the best solutions can be identified.
