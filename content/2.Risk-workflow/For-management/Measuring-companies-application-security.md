### Measuring companies' AppSec

Reviewing a company's technology allows us to understand its future. As more and more companies depend on their technology, and as more investment is directly connected to software developed by companies, there is a need for companies to provide independent analysis of their technology stacks.

Typically, this is something an analyst does, where they should be measuring both the maturity of the company's software development, and the maturity of its environment. The analyst should use public information to compile their evidence, and they should then use this evidence to support their data. Having good evidence means having explicit data on the record which clearly supports the analysis.

The power of the analyst is that they can take the time, and have the ability to create peer-reviewed, easy-to-measure, easy-to-understand analysis of companies.

Let's look at investments, as it is now easier and easier for people to invest in companies. If your idea is to invest in technology at the earliest stages of a company's growth, you want to be really sure it is going in the right direction. You should be able to get good metrics of what is going on, and you need a good understanding of what is happening inside these companies. Questions to ask include the following:

 - Are they using an old technology stack?
 - How much are they really investing in it?
 - How much are they really busking the whole thing? (because you know that is something that can easily happen, where marketing paints a very different rosy picture of reality)
 - Are they having have scalability problems caused by past architectural decisions?
 - Are they able to refactor the code and keep it clean/lean and focused on the target domain models?

If you have a company which is growing very fast, it makes a massive difference if the company is on a scalable platform or not.

In the past, companies could afford to let their site 'blow up' and then address problems after they occurred. That is no longer possible, due to the side effects, and particularly the security side effects, of any crashes or instability. Today, the more successful a company becomes, the more attackers will focus on it. If there are serious security vulnerabilities, they will be exploited faster than the company can address them, and this will affect real users and real money. We can see this happening with cars and the IoT (Internet of Things).

There is still a huge amount of cost in moving away from products/technologies, which is I call the 'lock-in index', and is whatever 'locks' the customer to the software.

The idea is that investors and users should have a good measure of how 'locked-in' a company is, and the technological quality of the application/service they are about to invest into.
