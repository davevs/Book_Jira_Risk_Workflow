### Rewarding Security Champions

* budget to sponsor the best one in last month (or week, if there is a lot of activity)
  * Participation in conferences (ticket + travel expenses)
  * Books
  * Bonus (some companies prefer old fashioned cash prices)
* How to measure who is the best of the month
  * Number of JIRA tickets: opened, fixed, tested
  * Number of Threat Models
  * Highest improvement
  * Innovative research
  * Shipped code (of an module used by multiple teams)
  * Above average documentation (Secure coding standards)
* provide presentation opportunities (for example at the company wide Security Champions conference, or to senior directors (a couple levels above the current developer's position in the org chart))
* basically anything that you can do to a developer that he/she can put on the CV is a good reward
* It is very important to create explicit and open rules about these rewards, since the worse situation is when a particular Security Champions receives an award not because of his achievements but due to other (political or friendship based) decision.
