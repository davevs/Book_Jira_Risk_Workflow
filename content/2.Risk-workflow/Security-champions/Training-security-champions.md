### Training Security Champions

  * Training is key to improve SC skills
  * Best training is done on top of languages and frameworks they use
  * Wiki pages with links to actual issues and relevant resources make a massive difference
  * Using vulnerable by design apps (or older versions of current main apps with known vulnerabilities) are a great way to learn (by exploiting them)
  * Writing exploits and finding vulnerabilities is a key step of the required accelerated  learning curve
