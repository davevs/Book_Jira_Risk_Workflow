### Weekly meetings

  * explain why these meetings are so important
    * what happens at one of these meetings
    * what is the normal agenda
    * who turns up
  * should happen every week, but a good compromise is for them to occur every other week
  * everything shown and discussed at the Security Champions meeting needs to be done via one or more slides (to be added to that week's slide deck)
  * these slides are VERY important when creating learning materials
  * create wiki pages with a full list of all past SC meetings (each entry is categorised by labels)
    * there are a great way to teach Security Champions and to call their attention to areas to research in their own apps
      * I've seen many cases where Security Champions will see a presentation on a topic/technology relevant to their current domain and think/say "Humm... I think we might be vulnerable to THAT vulnerability"

Initially, it will take considerable effort to generate content for these meetings; to find presenters; and to keep it engaging / interesting.

  * think of the money that it costs the company to have all those resources in there. Make it count and don't waste participants time
    * the developers are very busy and if the meetings are not relevant or not  interesting they will just don't turn up
  * central AppSec team (to help kickstarting the meetings) and to keep the energy level up) must always be looking for topics to present at the next SC meeting. For example:
     * Threat Models
     * AppSec Questions
     * AppSec ideas     
     * events from a point of view on an attacker
        * attacks
        * AppSec news,
        * basically any AppSec related topic that has not been presented recently)

#### Contents for weekly meetings

Here are some examples of what to present at these meetings:

  * Latest news on AppSec (DDos, exploits, etc..)
  * Latest bug-bounty findings and payments (a really good source of real-world examples)
  * Issues found and issues fixed (on the SC's application or service)
  * Secure coding techniques
  * Security tools and technologies (e.g. OWASP ZAP Project, OWASP dependency checker)
  * Tools/techniques to improve the Developer's Productivity (e.g. WallabyJS, NCrunch)
  * Hack challenges
  * Security reviews current in place
  * Other OWASP tools and documents (ASVS, OwaspSAMM, AppSensor, Testing Guide)
  * Testing techniques, workflows and technologies used (which might be different from the current development stack)
