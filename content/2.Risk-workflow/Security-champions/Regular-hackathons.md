### Regular Hackathons

Regular hackathons have many benefits for security champions, teams and companies. 

Security Champions should organize the hackathons, as hackathons are the next level of SCs applications. SCs can use them to find issues and learn new features.

They should be held every Friday or Monday afternoon, preferably with some drinks and pizza. 

Ideally, a hackathon would happen every week, but if not it should be held every two, three, or four weeks.  The important thing is to have movement.
  
The hackathon model fits well into the 10% of time developers need for research.

Inviting external experts, such as pentesters that regularly test the applications, has the benefit of providing new insights. Trying to do something, and then watching a more experienced and knowledgeable person do the same task, is one of the best ways to learn your job. You benefit from observing the workflow and strategies they employ to discover and exploit an issue.

Organizing teams into red (attackers) and blue (defenders) can also be very effective. However, planning your hackathon around teams makes it harder to organize, and needs a lot more preparation.
