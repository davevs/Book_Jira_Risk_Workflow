### Security Champions

  - So you want to be an SC?
  - ... here is how you do it...
  - Need to be a developer


### Becoming a Security Champion

To become a security champion, the most important property is that you want to be one.

You need a mandate from the business that will give you at least half a day, if not one day.

You need to be a developer who understands code, as it is difficult to be an AppSec SC and not be able to code.

Your job is to study your application and understand its security properties.

You need to look at the application from the point of view of an attacker. In the beginning the best way to get your head around it is to think about all the entry points of the application (i.e. inputs).

This includes everything the attacker can control: from GET/POST parameters, to WebServices calls, to headers, to cookies, to websockets, to anything that actually enters the application.

After that, authorization is also a great way to take a look.

Basically, start with creating threat models :)

Looking at how you handle data and how you authorize is a great way to understand how the application works.


### Hack anything that moves

You should hack anything that moves in your company, because you have a mandate to protect your own company (in some companies it might be better to get this 'hack everything' authorization via official channels).

In terms of targets, you can go for your own company, for your own application or for your colleagueâ€™s application (which sometimes it's a bit easier to digest).

### BugBounties

Also go for bug bounties, which is a nice list of companies that give you permission to 'hack/attack' them and find security stuff.

### Developers we need YOU in AppSec

 - big oportunity for existing developers to move into appsec

### Big market demand for AppSec Professionals

At the moment there is huge demand for AppSec devs. Historically the path info InfoSec via Network Security, which means that the majority of InfoSec professionals cannot move to AppSec, because they can't code professionally (i.e. no real knowledge on how to build, test and ship software/apps)

It is also possible to learn on the job since there is such a shortage, which makes it easier to hire Devs who like AppSec and then train them up.
