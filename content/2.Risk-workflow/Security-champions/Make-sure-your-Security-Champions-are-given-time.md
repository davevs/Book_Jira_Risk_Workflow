### Make sure your Security Champions are given time

It is very important that security champions get the time, the space, the mandate, and the information required to do their jobs.

The good news is, now that you have security champions (at least one per team), their work will allow you to see the differences between the teams and the parts of the company who can make it work, and those who struggle to make it happen.

To participate successfully in the security of their projects, security champions must execute the following tasks:

* review code
* fix code
* write tests
* know what is going on
* maintain the JIRA tickets
* create Threat Models
* be involved in the security practices of the teams

Adherence to these tasks leads to better code, better project briefs, up-to-date documentation and tests for the application.

Security champions should spend at least one day a week on these activities. Although allocating this time is easy for management to accept in theory, it is much harder to put into practice.

In the beginning, security champions will barely be able to spend a couple of hours a week at this work.

One of the things you should know from a central point of view is who is doing this kind of work, and who can spend the time doing it.

Fortunately, these things can be measured and tracked from the point of view of all the teams (using dashboards and graphs from the JIRA Risk Project).
