### Threat Modeling workshops

* to happen every week
  * or every other week, alternating with a Security Champions meeting (this way there is always an SC activity happening every week at the same time and place)
* good place to ask questions and to present Threat Models created during the previous week
  * If there are not a lot of materials to present or show, that indicates that the quantify of Threat models being created is quite low (note that the objective is to create Threat Models for new features, which are happening all the time)
* another great learning resource, specially for new SCs (who are still getting their head around the workflow)
* see Threat Models section for more details
