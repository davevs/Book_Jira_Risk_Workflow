### Learning-resources


**Books to learn from**

 * Hacking Exposed, both the normal version and Hacking Exposed: Web Applications.

 * The Shellcoder’s Handbook is a great book from an application security point of view, and it walks you through the vulnerabilities.

 * The Web Application Hackers Handbook provides a solid overview of problems in web applications and how to identify them


* (todo: add more books with a small description each)
  * Kevin Kelly books
  * The Circle
  * The Phoenix Project
  * Improving Web Application Security and Secure Code (from MS)
  * Geekonomics
  * Cathedral and the bazaar

(todo: add links to Amazon)

**OWASP Materials**

* [Cheat Sheet series](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cheat_Sheets) - one of the best AppSec resources on the internet
* Testing guide - good resource to start you AppSec skills.
* SAMM (Software Assurance Maturity Model)
* Developers Guide
* Code Review guide
* Top 10
* Top 10 for Mobile
* [Top 10 Proactive Controls](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Proactive_Controls)
* ASVS (Application Security Verification Standard)
* AppSensor guide
* [Automated Threats Handbook](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Automated_Threats_to_Web_Applications)

(todo: add links to projects)

**Vulnerable by design applications**

Another great resource is the OWASP WebGoat Project which just released a new version, and it has a selection of exercises in vulnerabilities so you can learn how they work and you can get clues if you get stuck. The first thing is to do the exercises and hack into these applications.

* Add more examples of apps, split by technology
  * .Net - WebGoat.Net, HackmeBank
  * Java - WebGoat
  * Node - NodeGoat, JuiceShop
  * Ruby - Railsgoat
  * php - Damn Vulnerable Web Application
  * Android - GoatDroid
  * iOS - iGoat
* [OWASP Broken Web Applications Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Broken_Web_Applications_Project)
* [OWASP Vulnerable Application Directory] (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Vulnerable_Web_Applications_Directory_Project)

**Hack your apps**

You can hack anything that moves in your company, because you have an implicit mandate to protect your own company.

Go for your own application, or go for your colleague’s application. Sometimes that’s a bit easier to digest :)

**BugBounties**

Also go for things like bug bounties, which are basically companies that give you permission to hack them and find security issues.

(todo: mention existing programs like https://hackerone.com/)
