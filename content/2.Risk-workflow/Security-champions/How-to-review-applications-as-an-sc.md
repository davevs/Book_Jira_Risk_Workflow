### How to review Applications as a Security Champion

When you review applications as a security champion, you need to start by looking at the application from the point of view of an attacker. In the beginning, this is the best way to learn.

You should start thinking about data inputs, about everything that goes into the database, the application, all the entry points of the application. In short, think about everything an attacker could control, which could be anything from headers, to cookies, to sockets, to anything that enters the application.

Authorization is also a great way to look at the application. Just looking at how you handle data, and how you authorize things, is a great way to understand how the application works.
