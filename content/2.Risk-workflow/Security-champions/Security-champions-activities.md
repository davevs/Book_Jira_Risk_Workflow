### Security Champions activities

What do Security Champions do in they allocated day-to-day time (4h to 8th)

* it is very important that JIRA tickets are use to map, track and allocate these tasks
  * the number of these tickets is what justifies the work the SC does
  * it also provides movement and management information about what is being done
  * it is important to have a good number of actionable (in the 'Allocated for Fix') stage (30 to 50 are a good number, as long as they are realistic and real)
  * you know the model is working when the managers start asking: "Do you have enough time of those SC activities?", "Do you need help from other team members (i.e. more resources)"
    * eventually the SC should also be managing the AppSec tasks that are performed by other team members
* the time allocation is better if done in blocks of 4h (over two days), or 2h every day (at the same time)  

#### Other AppSec projects to be involved in

* Map Attack Surface tool
* Web Services Visualisation tool
* Standard Schemas across the company
