### Don't blame the developers

A very common and dangerous misconception in the security world is that developers are responsible for any security vulnerabilities, or even security mistakes. 

The developers wrote the code, but it is essential to understand the ecosystem and the environment that produced that code.

Most developers don't control their schedule, their learning, or how much time they get to visualize and understand what they do. Therefore, to make them responsible for the code they are writing is a very dangerous and short-sighted analysis of their role. 

The key influencers of code are the development and the business managers, and the business owner, who controls what gets done and is responsible for what gets created.

The other challenge is that the current development frameworks and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) don't reward the visualization and understanding of the side effects of code. 

This means that when you are programming, it is very hard to understand the side effects of changing or adding a feature, or making a particular kind of implementation.

In such circumstances, how can we expect developers to be accountable and responsible for those code changes when they aren't aware of the bigger picture?

There might be some cases where the developers should know better, but in my experience, those cases are very rare. My experience is that developers want to do the right thing but they don't get the tools or even the allocation to do so.

Blaming developers creates a negative dynamic between security people and developers in an already adversarial blame culture. What we need to do before blaming the developers, is understand the ecosystem, and look at the reward system and the workflow. This is a much more positive way of looking at things.
