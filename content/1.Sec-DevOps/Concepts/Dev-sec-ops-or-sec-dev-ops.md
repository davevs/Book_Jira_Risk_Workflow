###  SecDevOps or DevSecOps

  * Which one is better
  * Which one sends the better message
  * DevSecOps seems to be getting a couple more google queries : https://www.google.co.uk/trends/explore?q=secdevops,devsecops
  * DevSecOps has the advantage that puts Dev (Development) first (which is good since that is most important part)
  * SecDevOps is a good extension of DevOps which is already a known practice
    * I also like the idea that when Security becomes embedded in the SDL and Sec-DevOps just becomes DevOps
  * I really like the definitions here
  * DevSecOps & SecDevOps - Is there a difference? https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/devsecops-secdevops-difference-kumar-mba-msc-cissp-mbcs-citp
