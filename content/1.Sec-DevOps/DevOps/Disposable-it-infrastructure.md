### Disposable IT infrastructure

Following the 'everything is code' concept, what you really want is an environment where your IT infrastructure is disposable. By this I mean that it should be very easy to rebuild, or recreate.  Consider the developer's environment, and how long it takes to create infrastructure. Then consider what happens to that infrastructure when the company hires more developers or the development team expands.

This is also an issue from a security point of view because it means that the developers, and even normal IT users, have a lot of black magic in their infrastructure. And if there is any Malware or malicious code installed in an application, then it means that it is in there for a certain period of time.

So, what you want is a situation where most of your infrastructure is automatically rebuilt. You want environments where developers' laptops reboot every Monday, where you overhaul the infrastructure from the bottom up, and where business owners use Chromebooks so that every install is fresh.

Your infrastructure should be disposable, you shouldn't care about it, and you should be able to easily rebuild, delete, or destroy, because that means all your data is backed up, and all your data is safe.

It also promotes the idea that in most scenarios, you shouldn't be able to access all the data or assets that your current user role has access to (i.e. you should only have access to that you need to do the job at hand).

It would be great if we had a Git-based operating system, with native support for version control, even at the operating system level. This would provide full control of what is going on and what is changed (on install and over time), by using git diffs and branches.
