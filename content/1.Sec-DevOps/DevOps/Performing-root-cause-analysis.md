### Performing root-cause analysis

* some environments make it hard to perform root-cause analysis, because it is seen as a blame exercise, instead of a learning opportunity
* Root-cause analysis are key for any bug (namely one the ones with Security implications)
  * lack of 'Root-cause analysis' is a risk (which needs to be accepted)
    * means business owners doesn't want to spend the time to find other (similar issues)
* add story of project manager that asked "please don't find more security issues during the retest (they are out of scope)"
* in an DevOps world, it is key for the root-cause analysis that there is a way replicate the issue (in an simulated environment).
  * the end-result of a root-cause analysis should be a Test (very close to a script) (that passes when the issue can be replicated correctly and reliably)
