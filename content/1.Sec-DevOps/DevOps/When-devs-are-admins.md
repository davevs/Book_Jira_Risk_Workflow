### When devs are cloud admins

* When moving to the cloud, Devs are becoming SysAdmins
  * which is a massive issue and is creating a large number of security issues
* in some cases this move is literally _'throwing the baby with the bath water'_ where lack of innovation, speed and features from the local admin/IT teams, pushed the developers to have free reign in the cloud (like AWS) where they can create servers and VMs in seconds (vs days, weeks or months)
