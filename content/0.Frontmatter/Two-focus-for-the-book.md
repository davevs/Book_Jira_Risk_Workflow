## This Book has a Dual Focus

This book has a dual focus.  First, it looks at how application security (AppSec) fits within the security, development and operations (SecDevOps) world. Secondly, the book demonstrates how a risk workflow is the key to making the SecDevOps world work.

The first part of the book considers the actions and the activities that AppSec introduces into SecDevOps. These actions include testing, insurance, and using the techniques that are part of AppSec to improve SecDevOps.

The second part of the book details a powerful technique that gives meaning to the work of SecDevOps in an organization. The technique is a risk workflow, based on JIRA or GitHub, that captures and tracks every action and idea, and their implications, that are raised by SecDevOps.  These ideas, actions, and implications must be considered, addressed, and accepted by the organization.

This book presents ideas, concepts, and suggestions to make the risk workflow work in the real world. The subject matter is entirely based on real-world experiences, real-world experiments, and real-world projects across small and large organizations.
