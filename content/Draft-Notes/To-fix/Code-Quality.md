### Draft notes - Code Quality

* Bad code and lack of testing has to be measured, since it has to have side effects.
  * If code has not tests but always works, all releases are smooth and there are no major incidents, then it is OK not to have tests,
  * ... now back in the real world ... lack of tests and weak CI will always have side effects:
     * problematic releases
     * customers finding bugs
     * long time to create features requested by business
     * quality issues on deliverables
     * weak and ever-changing briefs
