### Draft notes - Threat Models

* Do Threat Models in layers
  * identify each STRIDE issue per layer
  * each layer it built on top of the previous one
  * connect the threats
  * map the Urls and Data objects and connect them across layers
  * created 'refactored' and 'collapsed' views of the diagrams (specially when there are 'web services that act like proxies' in the middle)

* Introduce the concept of Sinks in Threat Modeling
  * how to connect the multiple threats (one for each layer) so that they are chained
    * map this concept with the concept of Attack Trees

* Idea to create a Book focused on "Threat Modeling examples and patterns"
