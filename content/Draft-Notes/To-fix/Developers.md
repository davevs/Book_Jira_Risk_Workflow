### Draft notes - Developers

* developers can be disconnected from their future-self
  * why are they accept and make decisions that will hurt them in the future
  * idea of showing the real cost of technological & coding decisions
    * Positive & Negative impact
    * one-off vs recurring cost/benefit analysis
  * we need developers to act more inline with their (and the apps) long-term interests
    * usually business owners are not made accountable for their technological decisions (they get the bonus for 'delivering' and move on to another project or company )
  * developers need to start picking fights on what is better for the business in the long run.
    * when they overruled, that needs to be 'on the record', which is better done with the JIRA Risk Workflow
    * best strategy to do this is to align yourself with the values and direction of the organization or company you are working for


* We should be able to predict when a developers is about to create a security vulnerability
  * based on similar patterns/code-graphs of other developers/code-changes in the past
  * Google and StackOverflow queries
    * detect bad results (maybe with even security vulnerabilities) and provide better recommendations
    * detect what questions they will ask next and suggest better results (proactive code-complete like, AI technology will help)
* Detect when code is one degree away from and exploit/vulnerability
  * Defense concept: always be or three degrees of separation from an serious vulnerably/exploits
