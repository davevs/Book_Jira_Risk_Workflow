As the insurance industry matures, and there are more and more companies that will choose to insure their risks instead of actually writing secure code and fix the applications is key that those values and those insurance premiums are made public. Because, those contracts will be a great measurement of how secure a company is.

The problem is we need ways to measure company's security. We need ways to measure what they are doing so that we reward the client, so that the entity making a purchasing decision can choose A, B, and C.

So, we can't have a situation where the only measuring sticks are features, reputation, cost and maybe some performance. We need security to be in there, we need companies to have in a way to pay a cost for not doing security.

Now, if the customer chooses to go with a particular vendor that clearly doesn't have application security practices, clear is not doing the right thing that is fine that is okay  that is market economics at work.

But my experience is that won't happen, my experience is these days more and more the clients are getting way more savvy. And if they can make sure the multiple products that they are consuming, then they will put pressure and in a way they will vote with their decisions which is really what you want to see happening.

And a great way this will occur is as the insurance company gets along which will push a much better validation of the issues which will bring a huge amount of rationality and  data points and data analysis into what is at risk, how you can measure, how you name it, how you define it, we need to make sure that those mappings and that information is all public.

And this is something that can easily not happen, but I feel that because the industry is still immature and is so young, we can actually point it in the right direction from now on.
