So, let's do the same thing for hacking, everybody can hack, the kids should be hacking all the time, they will love it because they are in the 'zone' we should support this activity like capture the school flag, like if you can freaking own the school network, you should be celebrated because you can change your grades, great you get another 10% just for that that is cool because that is how you learn.

But you should be rewarded, you shouldn't be seen as criminals, doing that generates the view hacking is bad, you should be celebrating those stuff.

And of course there is massive reward system. These days, if you are into security AppSec, we have 0% unemployment rate in AppSec, it is just you can't hire them.

And in fact if you guys are good in AppSec, I have companies in the UK that will hire you today, you just need to know how to program, be good AppSec guy and that is it.

There is really a massive shortage, so let's do the same thing for this.
