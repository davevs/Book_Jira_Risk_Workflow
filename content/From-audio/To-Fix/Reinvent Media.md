The media has to reinvent itself to become sources of truth. And one way to do that is to hyper-link proof.

Given the current infotainment and post lies world, we really need to get to the point where the media which is supposed to be the sixth state gains back its confidence.

And I think that it needs to do in two ways, first of all it needs to totally start being objective, it needs to abandon the popular, the kind of sensationalist people and kind of description of problems and of course there is always going to be one that will do but for the most serious ones they need to do that. And they need to start to provide evidence to what they claim or be able to rewrite or go back and update what actually happened.

And that means that that text becomes much more hyper-linked and much more accurate to what is going on.

And that is very important because ultimately if anything the articles needs to start showing whether they are biased, whether that is an attempt at being objective with the truth or that is a biased view of somebody.

And in a way that is okay if it is a biased view the bias should be clear, the bias should be objective and allow the viewer and the reader to actually understand where that bias is.

And that means that also when a reader is exposed to somebody saying things, they should be obvious, there should be like a truth-o-meter available directly on the articles. 

And it also means that when the media makes mistakes or when the media makes up news, they should be held accountable because ultimately the news should be objective.

And I think maybe you start to have standards where either the media is objective and it is important that it is objective against government, against government lies, against government exaggerations, against business exaggerations, so again it needs to be protected by that.

But when the media does make up stuff, they need to be held accountable, it cannot have both ways.

So, I think it is important that we use technology again that we are able to reinvent how news gets presented because they absolutely need to gain back their credibility.

And this might also pass by new forms of ownership because media depends on specific ownership models then we have a situation where they aren't going to be independent.

So this is another area where Portugal to lead by creating a media model that is actually much more mature and much more accurate. 

It also means that you need to invest, you need to pay well, you need to actually have really good talent, you cannot have junior journalists right out of college or without lots of experience or even emotional maturity writing things because ultimately they aren't going to get it right. 

You need maturity, you need talent, you need knowledge, people that actually are able to push the agenda and able to make both politicians and business and people accountable for their ideas and statements.
