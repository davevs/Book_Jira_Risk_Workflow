So, we have a great tradition of innovations, even things that maybe you don't realize, things like Multibanco, prepaid mobile phones, all the way to these great little paths, we have a great tradition of being innovators.

This is a great success story, I don't know how much you guys realize this but this was one of the cases I read about Portugal in a very positive way. This is Portugal leading the way, why is because we had the balls to make a really good decision, to treat drugs as a public health problem not a criminal problem.

This means that we are 10,000 more clever than companies in the world that declare war on drugs which clearly doesn't work. And UK it doesn't have a good drug record, so Portugal is a leader when we are able to make good decisions.
