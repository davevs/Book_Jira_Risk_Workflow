We should also have Portugal Hackathon League where we should organize hackathon. Just like we did for football we should bring our PT Hacking teams to DefCon, it should be a source of pride.

The same way that we run the football which is cool, we should be celebrating when our guys go to DefCon and become first or second over there.

We should be a source of pride to actually have the best and most elite hackers because there is a connection to Portugal, there is a connection to your country, and that is what you really want to be.

So this is a source of pride. And then it is also a great way to learn.
