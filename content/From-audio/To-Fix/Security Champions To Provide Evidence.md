An interesting thread that I have been having recently with security champions is that they really need to provide evidence for the tickets they open.

So it is quite nice when you have this work flow with the security champion opening up issues and they have been pract about it. In a way the next step is to start to provide very strong evidence about it and if they can that is an issue in itself.

And a good exercise for example for hackathons or for get togethers is actually come to the table. So for the security champions to come to the table and say, "hey, I think there is a problem, I think there is an issue can we prove it?" 

Because that is the key of the game, you have to build a proof, you have to be able to provide evidence for the findings you are actually opening up. And you need to basically be able to allow the person who will actually accept the risk or make a decision to really understand what is going on.

Which is why the exploits these are critical, see the power of exploits there because that is so critical, you really need to have evidence and sometimes you need an exploit to really show this is how it could happen, this is how the problem is and sometimes you do in production, sometimes you do in QA it depends on the impact. The key of all this is evidence and proof.
