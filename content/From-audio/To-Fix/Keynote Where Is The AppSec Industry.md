So, where is our AppSec industry? I don't think we have one really, issue is very small. I think it is a problem because we have a lot of talent and you could see this because you see every time you see an attack you see an AppSec team, it is one to one. 

So, I know it doesn't exist, in fact I know a lot of Portuguese in UK we are exporting AppSec talent to the UK, I actually work in London with a whole bunch of Portuguese guys.

I am not going to name where I work right now because I don't want to get into trouble but there is a huge Portuguese community in the UK.
