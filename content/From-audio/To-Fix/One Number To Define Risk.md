Reducing risk to a number, a very interesting idea given to me by a CISO friend is to reduce all of AppSec and InfoSec activities into one number, which gets presented to the board, which then can be used to measure what is the current risk profile.

In a way the number is a collation of multiple numbers which are then easy to understand and easy to map. And this actually is very tightly connected to the idea of maturity models where you use different...you measure the maturity of the multiple teams or multiple systems or multiple products and then understand better who is doing what.

What I really like about the maturity models is that it allows the temperature to be defined in the actual model, so it allows the temperature much more objective and much more pragmatic way of actually looking at the problem and looking at the issues and that is basically a really nice way of controlling the temperature and applying pressure on the right places.

And also knowing where to act because when you look at the multiple patterns and the multiple activities in the maturity model, you see which activities are working or it isn't working or is being done or not being done and that is a great way of analyzing the organization.

In fact even the individual items of the maturity model needs sometimes maturity models because when you say you have a security champion, the whole security champion world has in a way its own maturity model where in the beginning it is the binary, do you have one or not? 

Then you start to look at how effective they are, how knowledgeable they are, how actually able they are to perform their duties same thing with code reviews, same thing with path chain, same thing with management of dependencies, same thing with threat analysis, all sorts of stuff. 

All of those are basically things that you should measure the maturity model eventually leading to a higher one which eventually leads to a number.

So it is quite a nice work flow to do across the enterprise, it also scales really, really well.
