On the topic of hacking and solving little problems, when I was in Lisbon on the 'C' days, 2016 Conference, about to present, literally five minutes before it was about to start, we realized that for some weird reason, the projector was getting off 30% of my slides to the right.

That was in a way is a deal breaker because I couldn't, my presentation is mainly text. I was reading from the screen, so it would totally not work if you couldn't get that.

So I tried to change resolution of my laptop, I had never seen that problem before, didn't solve it and basically we were stuck and then Nunu a good friend suggested the idea of "Oh, actually why don't you export PDF and present it there?" And then I clocked it and I realized okay that might work.

So, I then actually was able to export it with all the slides, with all the transitions, which is important because I had literally one transition per paragraph. And I did it and I exported it and I got a PDF with actually 500 slides, and then I was actually able to re-size  it just to the size of what was happening on the screen basically with that 20% off adjusted.

And then actually I had a little mouse which I was going to flick the slides over and then that didn't work because it wasn't in full screen. So I actually asked Nunu to literally flick the slides one by one with his finger and I was giving him the clues and that actually worked.

And that is the hack, this is what hacks look like is when you have a problem, you have to think creatively, you have to solve something and you just make it work and then maybe another time the solution will get more solid but that is what is important is about to creatively find solutions for problems.
