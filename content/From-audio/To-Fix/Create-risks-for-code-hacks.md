Some say that you know the vulnerability where user and account ID was received from the outer world that was basically passed into the back end and user and he was able to just use easy to be data.

The root cause of those problems tend to be the fact that the controller is actually able to access and make those calls. So you need to open a risk for that. Then you also need to open another risk for the fact that your need to create an account ID from the front end from user data.

So there is already implication of that dangerous operation. And the third one is that actually step of actually using that you know the one that creates a vulnerability, passing the risk directly to the back end with the violation.

Now when you fix this a lot of times to fix is done at the control level so you add the method there to say, "hey this user has access to this, this user has access to this account".

The problem that is the wrong fix, it is a hack so you need to create a risk to that. Because the real fix should be done at the back end servers the real fix should be you should pass for example the user token or the back end and then use that to make a decision whether the user can access that information or not.

So that is a good example situation though the fix was formed, you actually the hack and also need to review other cases where that occurred. So you need to create a new ticket to be accepted to saying hey although we solved the problem it is actually not, we didn't fix the root cause of the problem and then add that as code references.
