And I also like this for a point, the best security model and I call this 'sane security model', isn't a security model based on having no vulnerabilities, no insecurities, no API dependencies, or no zero-days.

That doesn't exist in the real world. The security model is based on the attacker making a mistake because all attackers make mistakes, even guys like the NSA or whoever created the stock net which is still not officially acknowledged, they made a mistake, they crushed one odd little box that was running an odd anti-virus and that unraveled the whole thing.

And not just security model, now the question is can you detect it, do you understand your code, do you understand your applications, do you understand how everything works?

That is why that is so critical, and not just security model not for Portugal but for any company.
