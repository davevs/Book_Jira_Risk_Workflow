As the majority of the AppSec world grows up, it is very key to make very clear to business that a typical black box pen-test i.e. test of website from the outside world who know inner knowledge is at most a waste of money, at best just a check to see if a kid or a non specific attacker has a go at your application whether you will find the job or the pen-test is to find the blind spot.

In fact the job of the security assessment is to find the blind spot. Is to take everything you know about the application or their threat models or the assumptions, in fact all those ticket items that your security champs have raised as being the problem we don't have enough evidence and then find it.

So, in a way the job of security assessment is to improve your evidence, improve your evidence of the problem, or improve your evidence of how secure you are.

Which basically means that they need to have access to everything. And also it means that you need to capture everything they do, you need to capture in a way even the tests that they do which actually don't produce the findings they are very important because they in a way are your regression tests.

And if you can capture that it means that the pen-tests or security assessment has added a lot more value to your system.

It also means you scale more, it means that they are something that you can introduce more often because it is something that you actually get a lot of business return versus this issue that you are going throw over the fence that you do it.

So this is also very good for pen-testing teams because they can move up the food chain, they can actually be a lot more valuable to the company versus being some disposable entity and you are going to have this race to the bottom to see who can do it cheaper and who can do it in a way that looks good, doesn't necessarily mean that it is actually good.

And as attacks become much more real, as things become much more serious, you actually want to start to have the assurance of the pen-testing, companies need to move into a world where they provide assurance, where they provide proof of what they just found. 

And that is why they need to be able to provide evidence on what they performed and that is why they need to have access to everything that exists on the application.

Then once you have the findings you can make a risk based decisions whether you think your current level of attackers are  actually able to discover the vulnerabilities and which is more important are able to actually perform those actions in a way they can detect.

Because if you can detect how certain vulnerabilities that you have are exploited, and you can very quickly mitigate and prevent that for the damage then that is okay, then you can argue that you can actually leave them on because it is actually not a big deal.
