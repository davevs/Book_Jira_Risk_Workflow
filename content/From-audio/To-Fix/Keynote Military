So the military, I brought this thing up, I was looking at it say at the moment we would probably say that our cyber and code defense are as good as the Portuguese military.

The problem is the attackers are sophisticated as the best out there. 

So, you have to imagine that again Portugal will be attacked by the equivalent of US and China or France in terms of the UK.

Why do we have F16s?

And here is my question, why do we need the F16s? So I went to the Portuguese Armed Forces trying to figure out the thing and I found out that we have a nice F16, fleet of stuff and all these giants.

We have $2.1 Billion turnover, like why does Portugal need an offensive force? Can you guys tell me one scenario that F16s will actually come into play?

Give me a war scenario where we have somebody attacking Portugal, where our freaking F16s will actually do any value.

And I understand to have a civil air force because we have fires, border controls, but F16s? 

And by the way, the way you fight these F16s these days is you hack into them that is the way you defend yourself.

So, if you haven't read this book Ghost Fleet, I highly recommend because it shows how China theoretically took over the US because it kind of compromised the whole thing. 

So, if you use 10% of that budget, we can start a lot of things.
