We want to be proactive about this stuff and it is actually very mature. And again, like do you want to be like the rest of Europe be caught in a cross fire or do you want to be actually proactive and create an industry that will be very powerful but also very profitable?

So this is quite cool, what I am defending here can actually be really, really powerful and productive, and profitable for Portugal. 

So, it gives us jobs, it gives all sorts of stuff and drive industry.
