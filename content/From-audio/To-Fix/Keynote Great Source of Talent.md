So a great source of talent for example and this again is a bit controversial is that we should actually teach the convicted criminals how to hack. 

Because there are a lot of people that end up in prison for all sorts of reasons and probably you would do the same thing if you had those circumstance.

But there is a path to there that we lose a lot of talent to go into these guys, they are already kind of 'creative' because to be fair when you rob something or criminal you actually get your head to be different so we just need to give those guys a little interesting path to good use of their skills.

So give them a career, show them the way to make money legally, teach them ethics, and most criminals are due to bad choices.

So let's use that.

Even More Talent.

A great source of talent is retired people, again we lose them by not using their experience. In the past they were the wise ones, we now ignore them and remember you will be old soon so it would be nice if we can do this so that by the time we get there, it would be nice if we were respected and our ideas were still valued versus kicked out of society.

And the engineers, doctors, teachers, accountants, architects, parents etc. So there is a lot of talent there.

And remember you grow old not because of your age but because you stop being mentally active.
