Once you get high degree of code coverage, a really powerful technique that you can start to use is to start to run specific suite of tests and specific slices of the application and see what gets covered and what doesn't get covered.

It is very important especially on things like APIs where you are able to understand  what actually is tabled from the outside world and now you argue that especially from an API that is maintained as exposed, you want to make sure that you have no functionality in the application that actually doesn't exist.

And this could be a problem with some of the code coverage techniques, code coverage practices where it is easier to leave code there that doesn't get used any more but because it is tested, it is still in the application.

Basically you want to have almost zero tolerance for code that is currently not being used, any code that instead has no code paths or not being evoked should be eliminated from the application because you really want to make sure that the app is really in sync with its current capability and expectations and extra code be maintained, be reviewed and get rid if you don't want it there.
