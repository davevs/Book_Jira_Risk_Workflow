Here is the first idea for you, we should have the Portuguese Hacking Service.

So this is like we had this thing called 'Servico Militar Obrigatorio' you guys probably remember some of these things, we need to do the same thing for hacking. 

We need to have this service where 15 to 21 year old go and freaking hack the country. Everything that is moving, hack companies, code review open source, code review markets as 'strategic interest for Portugal' contribute to open source projects.

This will be a spectacular learning opportunity, this will be a great use of talent, of users create a new generation that understands those things.

It doesn't cost any money, it is just political, it is just a decision, it is just a direction.

But this will give us a lot of fuel, a lot of new things. And it also, I like this because it is almost like if you can't even stomach this idea then that is fine but this conversation will continue two years from now.

Because it is not even that radical but it feels radical because not a lot of people have done it before. But it is easy, we have the tradition, and we should do it.
