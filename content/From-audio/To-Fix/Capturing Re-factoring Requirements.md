What is very interesting is that developers want to re-factor, they want to get it better, they want to improve things in their code. But if you ask them, "where is the top 20, where are the things that you want to re-factor now?" you know if I from a management point of view say, "okay you can spend X time re-factoring, but what are you going to do?" Most likely they don't have it.

And the reason is because there tends to be a kind of a bar, a sort of a threshold for issues to be added to the bug tracking system. And the problem with that is that there is a lot of quality, a lot of re-factoring things that don't get captured into those bug tracking systems.

Actually, what I prefer is to have very small tickets, to have a specific bug tracking solution or project that is designed to capture all the quality, all the smaller than ten, fifteen minutes kind of tickets that you can then use it to capture those.

So these are all non functional requirements, these are all little things that it is like the incremental gains, they are all that 0.1% that 1% improvement that ultimately gets the application better and easy to maintain etc.

So if you get the practice of every time you see something in a code, every time you think of something that will be better, you capture it as a developer, as a manager, then what actually happens is that you create this nice pipe of work that can be used first of all in the morning when you are warming up for development but more importantly for new developers when they join the team that is where they should start.

So, in fact a good question is, when a dev joins the team, how fast, how long does it take for him/her to actually submit pull requests and push to production? And the reality, it shouldn't take long, it should be on the first or first couple of days because they should be addressing those little issues, they should be going on those little from typos to small things to re-factoring. 

So basically you know things that you can change or you should be able to change without affecting the application which ultimately it is what re-factoring should be.

So that will be the best way for them to learn, that will be the best way for actually a person to actually learn how the application works is by actually writing code, is by actually writing things that actually will go into the application which basically means that they are productive much sooner. And this is actually a much better way of learning. 

So by capturing these tickets, not only are you creating a much better representative of reality and you are capturing knowledge that otherwise would be lost when the developers move to newer teams, you are also making the new joiners of the team much more productive and you are creating a much better way to learn how the application actually works.
