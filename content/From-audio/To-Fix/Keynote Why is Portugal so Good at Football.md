So, why is Portugal so good at football? I think it is a very interesting question because we are one of the best in the world, we are literally pushing above your way.

So why is that? And I think one of the reasons is because everybody plays football, because our kids play it all the time, they love it. So they are in the 'zone' because when you are in the zone is when you learn. In a way we go to school to learn how to learn, we don't go to school to freaking remember all the historic facts and memorize formulas, and the stuff that we did in university, it is ridiculous my 13 year old does more math that are more complex than most of the stuff I program, never mind the stuff we had to do in university.

So that is when you learn, and also it is supported by school activities, there is a social reward in community, there is a support system to find out talent, there is massive financial reward for that stuff.

So that is what we need to do.
