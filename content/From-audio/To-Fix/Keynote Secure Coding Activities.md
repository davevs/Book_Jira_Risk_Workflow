For the guys that develop stuff I had to put some geek stuff on this. So, this is kind of what I call secure activities, security champions, that is the mug if you don't have a security champion in your team get a mug because it is better the mug as stack overflow. You need to code review, security coding standards, AppSec pipelines, do these pipelines, do threat models for app sec, feature, and layer that is the kind of stuff you guys should be doing.
