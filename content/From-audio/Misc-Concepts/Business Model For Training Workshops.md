A model that I believe has a lot of potential and a lot of opportunities is the idea of creating workshops and creating sessions, even training sessions with very respected and knowledgeable security experts.

So the idea is that you need or companies need an injection of talent, of knowledge to make sure that they are going in the right direction, to make sure that they basically are implementing these correctly, and sometimes just to give them the confidence or even tell management that that is the way to go.

So, the question is how do you scale this? Because the guys who can do this stuff are very expensive, or they won't be able to join the teams.

So, one interesting solution is to be able to bring those expert persons or it could be an expert in cryptography, an expert in SSL, an expert in spring security, an expert in more generic application security stuff, threat modeling, Geo work flows whatever and you basically bring that person that has the experience into the organization for an hour or a couple of sessions or ideally a couple of days or maybe a couple of days over a period of time, couple of weeks or months.

Now, the way that this works is basically the individuals don't have the time and the ability to actually be managing and finding the contacts and do all these things. So, it is very unlikely that the talent can actually find the person, so there is definitely a market problem here.

An interesting solution is to have companies who basically behave like agents for these individuals. And basically what they do is they find the work or they follow up work and then they book the work, they book the travel, they book the timing, they find all that stuff, they act as in-between because there is a lot of work there, it takes a lot of time, it is actually not that trivial to do all that stuff. 

So, actually there is a lot of value that exists there, that also shields a little bit those professionals who are super busy from those things, remove some conflict of interests and then there is an interesting model which is the agent model because in a way those AppSec, InfoSec persons are the talent that in a way is sold or managed by these companies.

Now the key question is what is the financial model? Because it has to be fair for both, it has to be one where there isn't a bigger symmetry between what the person ultimately creating the value stands with the knowledge gains and all the work that the guy selling it and managing it and doing the financing and all that jazz too.

So one interesting option is maybe fifty-fifty split where fifty percent goes to the presenter and fifty percent goes to the company organizing it which is kind of similar to what happens in some situations, maybe the sixty-forty for the presenter but again we want to make sure it is also incentivized for the sales guys because they also spend a lot of time selling to a lot of people who won't buy the thing. So I kind of come back to the fifty-fifty as probably a fair amount, a fair value.

And also I think it is also something that it needs to be total transparency between all parties. So that takes the trust and also creates this bonding relationship where it becomes much harder or where somebody contacts directly the supplier or the talent and the talent deals with the person directly.

And I think it is important to create something that it isn't as asymmetric where if it was like 25% for the trainer, then the person might go or the resource might go, "well actually I might go directly or it is okay to go directly."

So that is the first kind of model that I think could work quite well but also it is important that the concept and the paradigm is really of agents. So that means that the website should really be selling, the entity should be selling that person and exposing that person down to the user.

And actually you know maybe for some more high profile persons there the value is higher because they can generate high fees and they can basically push that transparency quite high up. Because ultimately, it should be a market demand, the more demand there is for a particular individual, the more he can charge that is why the politicians and the celebrities charge a lot of money because there is a lot of demand and this is a finite resource because when you look at specific items, there is going to be a finite resource of individuals that can do that kind of training and that kind of workshop.

So that is fundamentally the model, it is a model based on agents and then talent and ultimately it is about treating well the talent. So the better the talent is treated, the more likely that relationship will occur.

And from a trainer's point of view or the person delivering the workshop point of view, I think it is also fundamental is that it doesn't need to require a lot of work on their part, basically they should just go in there presenting and talking about the stuff they do in their day job.

So, it should be actually pretty easy because all they are doing is sharing knowledge of stuff they are actually already doing in their day job.

And one more thing, this also allows individuals to for example stay in companies that might not pay as well but have very interesting jobs and very interesting projects or very interesting freedom or like politics into what happens but then allow them to do one day a month or one day a week or a couple days a month extra working sessions to top up and to really make sure that then the income is balanced out and kind of balance out both worlds.
